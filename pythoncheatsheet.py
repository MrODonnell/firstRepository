# To get started you need to be aware of three data types:
# int is an Integer
# float is a decimal
# sting is letters, words, whitespace, and special characters including numbers

# Addition uses the + operator
num1 = 3
num2 = 4

sum = (num1) + (num2)

print('-The Sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))
# Subtraction uses the - operator
num1 = 9
num2 = 6

sum = (num1) - (num2)

print('-The Difference of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))
# Multiplication uses the * operator
num1 = 2
num2 = 5

sum = (num1) * (num2)

print('-The Product of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum)) 
# exponent uses ** as the operator
num1 = 7
num2 = 3

sum = (num1) ** (num2)

print('-The Power of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))
# Division is more tricky than you might think.
# Be aware that in Python 3 division results in a float

# Division uses / as the operator and returns a float

#### day two ####

# a void function has no return value
# but it may output, like using a print statement



# The return statement will stop a function
# and optionally pass an expression back to the caller
 
#### Day Three ####

# Scope

# Passing an argument to a function

# Boolean operators

# equals

# not equal 

# greater than

# greater than or equal to

# less than

# less than or equal to

# if statement and elif

# while loop using an increment

# while loop using range()


# nested loop


# Day four

# Lists

# create a list

# retrieve a value using an index number

# lists are zero indexed, so the first element is 0

# negative number count back from the last item

# There is a shortcut to loop through a list

# The keyword "for" loops through a list
# The keyword "in" assigns each value to the variable that comes before "in"

# List slice

# Dictionaries

# As directed by pep 8 do not exceed 80 characters per line

# loop dictionary using items

# The hanging indentation helps keep 80 char limit and improve readability
